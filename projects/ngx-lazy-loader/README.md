# NgxLazyLoader

This library helps with lazy (dynamically) loading any modules and inner features.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project ngx-lazy-loader` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project ngx-lazy-loader`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project ngx-lazy-loader` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build ngx-lazy-loader` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build ngx-lazy-loader`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/ngx-lazy-loader` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test ngx-lazy-loader` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
